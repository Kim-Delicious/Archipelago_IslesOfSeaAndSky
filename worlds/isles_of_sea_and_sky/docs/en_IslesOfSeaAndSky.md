# Isles Of Sea And Sky

## Where is the options page?

Currently, there are no options available, but there are plans.

## What is considered a location check in Isles Of Sea And Sky?

Location checks in Isles Of Sea And Sky are all the spots in the game where you can get an item. Exceptions are the three Eggs and the Wind key on Frozen Spire, 
Music Puzzles, Tablet puzzle on the Stony Cliffs, and the Totem Puzzle on Raging Volcano. Notably, the Four Bells, each Gem Quest completion, and each Sanctum Shard hit are all considered checks.


## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Isles Of Sea And Sky, it will go into their inventory. When certain items are gained, the player character will dance, or a cutscene will begin.
During these events, no more items will be received until either event is over.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player makes it to the end of the game, and enters the Normal Ending cutscene. (More routes are planned).

## What is different from the vanilla game?

Nearly every item and cutscene has been decoupled from acquisition, meaning a player will need to be sent nearly every item in the game.
