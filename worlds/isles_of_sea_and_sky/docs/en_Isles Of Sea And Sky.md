## What is considered a location check in Isles Of Sea And Sky?

Location Checks in Isles Of Sea And Sky are all the spots in the game where you can get an item. 

*(Exceptions are the three Eggs and the Wind key on Frozen Spire, 
Music Puzzles, Tablet puzzle on the Stony Cliffs, and the Totem Puzzle on Raging Volcano.)* 

Notably, the Four Bells, each Gem Quest completion, and each Sanctum Shard hit are all considered Checks.

In addition to these Checks there are a number of checks sent through object interaction. 
Such as opening the Big Door on the Ancient Isle.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Isles Of Sea And Sky, it will go into their inventory. When certain items are gained, the player character will dance, or a cutscene will begin.
During these events, no more items will be received until either event is over.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved depending on the route:

Normal ending: when the player makes it to the end of the game, and enters the Normal Ending cutscene. 

Secret Ending: when the player makes it to the end of the game with at least 109 Star Pieces. 

All Gems: When the player collects at least the number of gems possible. (12 Topaz, 12 Sapphires, 12 Rubies, 12 Diamonds, 12 Obsidian)
## What is different from the vanilla game?

Nearly every item and cutscene has been decoupled from acquisition, meaning a player will need to be sent nearly every item in the game.

All items have their sprites replaced with a generic AP sprite.

A toggleable in-game console is displayed that shows the most recent item acquisitions,
as well as the current room.

## Where is the options page?

Currently, there are no options available on the website.
You'll need to modify them manually.

## What do all these options mean?

### QOL

**Phoenix Anywhere** allows the player to use the phoenix flute to be picked up in any location (besides the Overworld)
instead of just the small drop-off spots located on the large islands. Meaning that the player can
be picked up from, say, the Serpent Stacks, or the Sunken Island, and be dropped off at the Frozen Spire.

### New Content

**Include Jellyfish** enables hidden jellyfish in the Overworld for extra location checks.

**Include Seashells** enables disguised seashells on the Tidal Reef for extra checks.

### Sanity Options

 **Locksanity** sends Checks for unlocking all sorts of things in-game. Including Rune Locks

 **Snakesanity** sends Checks for activating snake-blocks, and Overworld Dams


 **Secretsanity** sends Checks for discovering secret paths, and hidden objects

### Everything Else

**Required Route** tells the game which method you'll beat the game with.

**Filler Composition** changes the junk items you'll be sent so that there's a 
higher chance you get something useful.
